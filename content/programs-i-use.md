This is a list of applications I find very helpful!   
  
## Windows Programs  
### [Keypirinha](https://keypirinha.com/)  
  
### [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/)  
  
## CLI Programs  
🪟 means it's windows only.  
🐧 means it's linux only.  
  
### [git-identity](https://github.com/madx/git-identity)🐧  
I installed using [basher](https://github.com/basherpm/basher) which may get its own entry on here eventually.  
  
### [starship.rs](https://starship.rs/)
