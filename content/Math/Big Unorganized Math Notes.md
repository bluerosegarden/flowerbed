Turns out making specific pages for each note has been bad for me actually making notes, so here I'm just gonna spam all the notes without much explaining. I'll spin em off into their own notes later, or not, we'll see lmao

## Polynomial functions

### Graph Behavior

When the degree is **even** and the leading coefficient is **positive**

$$
x\rightarrow-\infty,\; y\rightarrow\infty\\
$$

$$
x\rightarrow\infty,\; y\rightarrow\infty
$$

> [!graph]
> ![[8x exp(4)+2x-1.svg|8x exp(4)+2x-1.svg]]

When the degree is **even** and the leading coefficient is **negative**

$$
x\rightarrow-\infty,\; y\rightarrow-\infty
$$

$$
x\rightarrow\infty,\; y\rightarrow-\infty
$$

> [!graph]
> ![[-8x exp(4)+2x-1.svg|-8x exp(4)+2x-1.svg]]

When the degree is **odd** and the leading coefficient is **positive**

$$
x\rightarrow-\infty,\; y\rightarrow-\infty
$$

$$
x\rightarrow\infty,\; y\rightarrow\infty
$$

> [!graph]
> ![[8x exp(5)+2x exp(2)-1.svg|8x exp(5)+2x exp(2)-1.svg]]

When the degree is **odd** and the leading coefficient is **negative**

$$
x\rightarrow-\infty,\; y\rightarrow\infty
$$

$$
x\rightarrow\infty,\; y\rightarrow-\infty
$$

> [!graph]
> ![[-8x exp5+2x exp2-1.svg|-8x exp5+2x exp2-1.svg]]

Because of this you can determine the the behavior just by looking at the function

## Zeroes of a Polynomial function

All x-intercepts are zeroes (also known as _roots_) of a polynomial function, but not all zeroes of a polynomial function are x-intercepts.

Also all zeroes of function are a part of its factor! If $x=a$ is a zero of $f(x)$ then $(x-a)$ is a factor of $f(x)$.

To find the zeroes of a function, you set $f(x)$ to be 0, and then solve by factoring (You probably will need the [[Important Formulas|Important Formulas]]).

$$
\begin{gather}
f(x)=2x^2+11x-6\\
2x^2+11x-6=0\\
(x+6)(2x-1)=0\\
x=-6,\,\frac{1}{2}
\end{gather}
$$

There can't be more zeroes than the degree of a function.

If you use the [[Important Formulas|Important Formulas]] and get an imaginary number, it's still a valid zero, even if it's not a valid x-intercept.

So a function with a degree of 8, can have up to 8 zeroes, but they can be less.

### Multiplicities

A repeated zero is one that's repeated, usually denoted by raising it to a certain power.

For example:

$$
g(x)=x^3-3x-2=(x-2)(x+1)^2
$$

As a result, the zeroes of this function are $x=2,\,x-1$. You don't write the duplicated zero twice, however you describe it by having a multiplicity of 2 (or 3, or however many times that zero shows up)

For example:

$$
h(x)=x^3+9x^2+27x+27=(x+3)^3
$$

The zero for this would be $x=-3$ with a multiplicity of 3.

When the multiplicity is **even**, the graph **bounces** off the x-axis but does not cross it.

When the multiplicity is **odd**, then the graph **crosses** the x-axis.

## Characteristics of a graph

Let's step through how to find the following characteristics of the following function and graph

$$
f(x)=-2x(x-3)^2+8
$$
