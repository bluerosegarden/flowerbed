This is where I'll have various shortcuts.

## Quickly Foil $(x-b)^2$
If you have something like this

$$
\begin{align}
(x-8)^2 \\ 
\end{align}
$$
Instead of manually FOILing it out, you can just do this:
First, be sure to keep the b's sign the same when doubling it, weird I know!
$$
\begin{gather} \\
x^2+2(b)+b^2
\end{gather}
$$
So the above example would be 
$$
\begin{gather} \\
x^2+2(-8)+(-8)^2\\
x^2 -16+64
\end{gather}
$$



if the last two digits are divisible by 4 then the whole thing is divisible by 4!


11 * a number with 2 digits, add the two digits together and put it in the middle

so for example 

11 * 72 = 792!

if it goes over 9 then you just roll it over 

11 * 89 979
