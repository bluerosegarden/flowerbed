This is where I'll have various shortcuts.

## Quickly Foil $(x-b)^2$
If you have something like this

$$
\begin{align}
(x-8)^2 \\ 
(x+3)^2 \\ 
\end{align}
$$
Instead of manually FOILing it out, you can just do this:
First, be sure to keep the b's sign the same when doubling it, weird I know!
$$
\begin{gather} \\
x^2+2(b)+b^2
\end{gather}
$$
So the above examples would be 
$$
\begin{gather} \\
x^2+2(-8)+(-8)^2\\
\downarrow \\
x^2 -16+64\\
\\
x^2+2(3)+(3)^2\\
\downarrow\\
x^2+6+9
\end{gather}
$$


## Head shortcuts
These are shortcuts that're quick enough to do in your head!
- If the last two digits are divisible by 4 then the whole thing is divisible by 4! $\frac{2949\color{red}28}{4}=73732$
- If you want to multiply 11 by any number with 2 digits, add the two digits together and put it in between the two digits! $11 \cdot42=462$
	- if it goes over 9 then you just roll it over! $11 \cdot 89 = 979$
