These are going to be all of my notes on math, ones that work specifically for me but may work for you

## Resources

- [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator)
  - Great site to graph and export graphs to SVG. A little wonky if you want a specific size, but it works!
- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
  - The best site for graphing if you JUST want a line, no points or anything. You can export in png or SVG in a constant size (unlike GeoGebra)
