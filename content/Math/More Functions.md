## Inverse Functions

It's possible for a function to have an inverse function. in order for there to be an inverse function, the base function must satisfy the **horizontal test**, meaning for every $y$ value, theres only one possible $x$ value. Because if that, each pair of numbers must not repeat.

Because of that, you get some interesting phenomenon!

For example, they are always mirrored on the $y=x$ axis!

Also, if you have the point $(a,b)$ on on function, on the mirrored function you'll have the point $(b,a)$
