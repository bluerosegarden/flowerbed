A place for me to just talk off the cuff about my personal goals and plans.   
  
## Winter Break 2023  
  
- Draw! Daily!  
	- Read and practice [The artist's way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Way)  
- Learn [[Typescript|Typescript]]  
	- I already know a lot of Javascript!  
- Learn Processing and do some [[creative coding|creative coding]]  
	- [Looks like a great video about it](https://youtu.be/4JzDttgdILQ)  
- Make EXEdeus  
	- Will be made with [[Godot|Godot]]  
	- A PWA app with most (if not all) local running  
	- I've already started a bit on it, but I need to workout the command parsing  
	- The goal is to create a good system for AFK dungeon delving, similar to how it's done in [Logging Quest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shirobakama.logquest2&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) for use in faemon eventually.  
- Restart learning [[Japanese|Japanese]]  
	- Especially using my new [[Textbook Collection#Japanese|textbooks]]  
- [[Books|Read more!!]]  
- Play Games!!  
- Get my [custom markdown blog](https://github.com/bluerosegarden/magical-musings) setup  
- [[Exercise|Exercise]]  
	- Improve endurance, I need to do research on it and find a good method to do so.  
	- Wait until treadmill is installed?  
- Meditate  
- Organize my Obsidian Vault  
	- [ ] Remove unused plugins  
	- [ ] Decide on organizing structure  
		- I need a system that both works with my ADHD and still makes it easier to find things long-term  
		- Excalibrain?  
		- [Johnny Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) didn't work out before, and I ended up spending more time trying to organize before just writing down files. Maybe only implement this for folders and not files? And only for long-term storage  
		- Also use tags!! Tags are important. Also links!!  
			- But what to tag and what to just put in folders? Maybe little to no folders?   
		- [LATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-b_RUtL1A) method sounds nice maybe.   
		- [A.C.C.E.S.S.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0zWJ-TLghw) method.  
	- [ ] Delete & Consolidate useless notes  
	- [ ] Pull everything out of old vault and into new vault
