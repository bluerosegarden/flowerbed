## Class Notes  
- Do Example Code and work on labs during class  
- Do reading and watch videos before class  
- Project 1 we'll be creating a ticket  
- We'll also be bug-fixing!  
- -> Next week is pointers   
- Using is ok but if things get more complex it might be good to not use that and instead access it directly  
	- like `std::function()`  
- For bug fixing  
	- Assign a bug to yourself through gitlab
