In preparation for my first Trigonometry test, I decided to create my own unit circle using Affinity Designer (Well, penpot at first until I ran into performance issues)  
  
I did this in order to discover any patterns, and to better understand it before I try to create a shorthand version.

After creating this, I recognized a pattern that I think can be best described with this reference I created  
  
![[shorthand 2.svg|shorthand 2.svg]]  
Which I will reduce down to this when I write this when using the Unit circle
