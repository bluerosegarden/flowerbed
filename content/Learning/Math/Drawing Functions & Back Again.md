Take the following graph  
![[drawing functions 2.svg|drawing functions 2.svg]]  
  
In order to recreate (one possible) function we need to do the following:  
1. Determine the end-behavior, and decide if it's a reflection or not (this one is a reflection of a ^2!)  
2. Determine its stretch/squash  
   - count the squares, if its over more than 1 then add that many as the denominator (the above would be 1/2) and you got the coefficient!  
   - Otherwise if its taller more than 1 before it crosses a point add that many and add that as the coefficient!

         - This would be 2!  
         - Think of it like when you find the slope, by going $\frac{rise}{run}$   
3. Next add the adjustments to the vertex as appropriate! inside the parathesis for horizontal movement and outside for vertical movement
