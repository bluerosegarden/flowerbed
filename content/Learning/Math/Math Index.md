These are going to be all of my notes on math, ones that work specifically for me but may work for you  
  
> A math meme that is funny rather than stupid: Solve carefully! 230 - 220 x 0.5 = You probably won't believe it, but the answer is 5!

## Resources   
- [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator)  
	- Great site to graph and export graphs to SVG. A little wonky if you want a specific size, but it works!  
- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)  
	- The best site for graphing if you JUST want a line, no points or anything. You can export in png or SVG in a constant size (unlike GeoGebra)  
- [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)  
	- Python library for animating math. Used by the likes of [3blue1brown](https://youtube.com/@3blue1brown?si=EvEK9JgeDwFAPkSk)
