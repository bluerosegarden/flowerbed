A game where you recreate a constellation using as few functions as possible   
  
Other ideas: the normal get problems to solve to reveal points for a map. Maybe ask teacher for help  
  
Draw mockup I guess?? And print out and show during class yeah  
  
Ok basically do this  
  
For programming create a dictionary containing the problems and their components, like {fx:2, fy:3: a:x, b:8, c:8} or however many elemenrs there are   
  
You build this by taking the actual end result (fx and fy) and fuckin with them until you get a function  
  
Ok how do you get the x's? By solving *another* math problem like   
$$\begin{align}  
4a+a=10\\  
a=2\\  
b-2=8\\  
b=10  
\end{align}  
$$  
  
Then swap em out or add them (or multiply) them together  
  
Generate huge formulae to get those values too  
  
$$  
x^4+3x^3-5x^2+2x+8=0  
$$
